## Disclaimer
Documentation will be provided in the event that we receive a bunch of requests. In the meantime, just read over the code before you use it- the majority of the functions are self explanatory. In order to fully understand what is going on here and how to implement this into your own program, please read up on Tradestation's [DOCUMENTATION](https://api.tradestation.com/docs/specification).
